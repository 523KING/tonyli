	sh startup.sh ( you can type "chmod 777 startup.sh" first, if needed)


	
how to use:
***********
fridge csv files(in "data" folder) describe food materials in fridge
input the fridge file name after this line: "please input fridge csv file name(e.g fridge.csv), or type finish."

recipe json files(in "data" folder) describe recipe options
input the recipe file name after this line: "please input recipe json file name(e.g recipe.json)"

What's more. If you want to find another recipe, you do not need to run the app again.
You can just input the fridge file name and then recipe file name as many times as you want.
